### Hi.

#### I'm Sofía.

&nbsp;

I usually define myself as a *state-of-the-art trans gal*. But, what does it mean?

Let me tell you: I'm a transgender woman who currently lives in Santiago, Chile. I'm 29, I have a BSc in Biology and a minor in Entrepreneurship, I work as a Full-Stack Developer, and I also have a special interest in photography, fashion and politics. That kind of interests make me a very particular person. But mostly, I like to have the opportunity to share with and for the world.

If you want to know about my everyday stuff, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/szapatazavala) & [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sofiazapatazavala). Some of my recent works are available on  [GitHub](https://github.com/sofiazapatazavala). And if you want to write me, find me on **hola [at] szz [dot] cl**.

Welcome!

#### S.
