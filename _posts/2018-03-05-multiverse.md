Now that I've changed, now that I'm me, now that I'm looking to the world from where I always wanted, I've been questioning a lot of stuff (and I think that's gonna be a very frequent practice from now on).

One of those things is my decisions. Of course, there's no bad decisions; each one of them have been the ones that brought me here. But, what could have been if I'd took some courage... before?

*For example, this could've really happen? (that's me in our local uniform, haha)*

I'll keep declassifing issues from my first adolescence: My parents wanted to change me from the school where I was because they didn't like my friends from that time. There was nothing wrong with them, but they didn't tolerate them. That's it. Of course, there's people who don't tolerate me now, but that's another story.

OK, focus: If I'd said "yes", could I be where I am now? Or, in a better way of speaking, how harder (or easier) could that effort be?  Could I have had the amount of privilege that I'm having today, or... Could I just have been suffering a lot? I'll never know. It wasn't like that. Nevertheless, I like to imagine myself in a multiverse where I took different decisions. Like, coming out at 15. What could've changed? Not a lot, if I still feel like my family don't love me. I just wanted peace, and a place for me.

A place I haven't stopped building. And that's something I want to fix.

**PS, about the theme**: This is the Alpha 1 for the version 1.0. Some important stuff:
- This theme will be usable for everyone! A few days *(weeks, really)* ago, I noted someone forked this repository. And I normally let myself down when it comes to my design skills (even when designers have told me I'm good). So I'm following that trend, and the theme will be completely separated **very soon**.
- Now, this site is built over Jekyll 3.5. Part of these alphas will fix everything to keep up with the latest Jekyll version on Windows.
- Our base CSS is Bootstrap 4.0, *period*. A final version for a headache now forgotten.
- More stuff coming soon!
