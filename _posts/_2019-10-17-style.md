Almost one year ago I wrote about how my personal style evolved across the years, while I learned to dress according to my new *(actual)* reality. And yes, something changed since I started.

First, I believe this is not something shallow nor something I can separate from myself. Opposedly, this has been **central** on my own development, and that's important because you can tell I'm a fashionista from far away. So, why deny it? Anyway, I proposed myself to add content to my proposal and to my learning,  because I believe it's important to strengthen my image, aligned with my beliefs and with everything I do in general.

With that said, let's take a look.

### Style revision: 2018-2019

As always, I tell you that Jekyll doesn't have server-side code to rotate photos according to their EXIF, so visualization will be decided by your browser.

#### End of 2018

I was trapped in my darkest version, conditioned by the fantasy hair I had by that time. That made my formal outfits feel diminished, which wasn't important since I work from home.

#### Start of 2019

My summer was heavily influenced by the relationship I had, and how accompanied I felt at first (and how that vanished over time) with some style-related issues. Also, in January I started the Personal Styling course, and with it I learned *the rules*. I talked about it on my previous post, and I think the changes are notorious, don't you think?

#### Middle of 2019

Despite being told to not cut my hair for any reason, **I still did it**. But, my bob's never shorter than my long-shaped face (*I learned, see?*). When my fantasy color was removed, my hair turned into the most versatile to live all of my styles, sometimes *grunge*, sometimes *preppy*, sometimes both, sometimes none of them. By this time, I started to make an effort to have a more sustainable wardrobe. What am I talking about? Let me show you the pictures first.

### 2019-2020: A more sustainable wardrobe

I wish to start this second part making noticeable that I started to "repeat" clothes more than one could "expect" according to this fashion/lifestyle blogger concept that's being currently sold on Instagram. I don't care. Why? Because that's **not sustainable**. Don't be fooled, probably will see your influencers saying the same thing, but the problem isn't the clothes. *Is their dynamics*: probably that promoted clothes made with a non-plastic material will still have to travel across half of the planet, and you'll still see it only once on that feed. Fancy garment, but still disposable.

So, since stopping your own consumption is a great thing to do, there's a phrase you start to hear when you become aware of the problem: "the most sustainable clothes is the one you already have".

I'll do my part, and I started to apply these quick actions:

- **No more 100% polyester clothes**, unless it's recycled. In the short term I'll rise the bar to ban garments with more than 75% and more than 50%, even knowing that mixed fabrics are even more problematic for recycling. The less petroleum-based clothes the better.
- No more clothes disposal. I have to say, that's what I did for a long time (since my complete wardrobe renewal), without worrying about it. Since I don't know people who upcycle, I'll probably separate it so the garbage collectors take it, donate it, or recycling it (which is in fact downcycling, but it's something).
- Choosing local design and making. Is it necessary to pay so much on shipping so you can have something from the US, the UK, from China? Obviously, if you can find something on Chile you buy it here. And if I can bring something from a trip, I do (as I've done it in Buenos Aires). We have the advantage of having good design, and it's going strong towards a wider audience, as it already happened with shoes in the last few years.
- Adding what I'm missing, not "changing what I already have". This is not about having a pure wardrobe at once, because that generates the same garbage in the end. When a garment reaches its end of life, I'll change it for a more sustainable piece. So, I'll still be having polyester on my wardrobe? Yup, but I won't bring more of it anymore.

Probably I'll still be "completing" my wardrobe, since there are many of the *must-have* garments which I still don't have. But doing it in an adequate way, in these times, means doing it on a conscious way. And, of course, with that wardrobe I'll keep protesting so businesses do their part too.
