### Hello again!

If I'm honest, I question myself the fact that I have to write a blog in the same environment where I work (I have to remind you that [this blog is powered by Jekyll][https://jekyllrb.com], and you have to code every post). But here I am, trying once again.

So, apart from sending a commit to update the site's libraries, I wanna share with you that I'm gonna make a very special project to determine how much money I have spent in my transition so far.

How I plan to do it? I'll tell you how I got the data: **I stored 4 years of receipts**. I'm gonna index them, see any tendence and how my path evolved, leaving the dark times behind.

I'll keep you informed.
