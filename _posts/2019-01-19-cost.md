### 2nd edition (26/01/2019)

I started with the data from 2018. Everything is there. I'm surprised with these things:

- I spent in shoes less than I thought.
- I shouldn't spend so much in haircuts (and that's what I wanna do soon).
- I'm convinced that my meds are affected in a new collussion of pharmacies.
- That, more than everything, I'm living a normal life. Inside the limitations that my fears imposed and that I have to break.

I'm very anxious for showing you the data.

### 1st edition (19/01/2019)

#### Hello again!

If I'm honest, I question myself the fact that I have to write a blog in the same environment where I work (I have to remind you that [this blog is powered by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and you have to code every post). But here I am, trying once again.

So, apart from sending a commit to update the site's libraries, I wanna share with you that I'm gonna make a very special project to determine how much money I have spent in my transition so far.

How I plan to do it? I'll tell you how I got the data: **I stored 4 years of receipts**. I'm gonna index them, see any tendence and how my path evolved, leaving the dark times behind.

I'll keep you informed.
